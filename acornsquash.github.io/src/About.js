                <p>Hi! Iâ€™m Ina, a bartender-turned-software-engineer currently based in NYC. In early 2020 I started teaching myself to code, began my career change as a bootcamp grad by spring of 2021, and have been developing and expanding my skills as an engineer with the help of the excellent dev team at <a href="https://qz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Quartz</a> for the past nine months.
