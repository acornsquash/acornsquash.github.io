                <p>Hi! Iâ€™m Ina, fullstack software engineer based in NYC. In early 2020 I started teaching myself to code, and began my career change as a bootcamp grad in the spring of 2021. Soon after I was given the opportunity to develop and expand my skills as an engineer with the help of the excellent dev team at <a href="https://qz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Quartz</a> for nearly 4 years. I am currently looking for a new role.
